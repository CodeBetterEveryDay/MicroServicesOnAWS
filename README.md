# MicroServices On AWS
Course Materials for Microservices on AWS

## Introduction 

This course serves as an introduction to running various services on AWS.  We show how these "microservices" can be stitched together to make a working application. Going through this course will give you an idea of what a "Full Stack" developer does.  You will be configuring services and writing code.  

Our application is a simple photo album complete with object recognition.  

Check out the [Tech Stack](./TECH.md) to see the technologies that will be used through this course.
