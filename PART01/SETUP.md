# Set Up


## AWS Account 

To get started with this course, you will need to have an AWS account that gives enough permissions to do the actions here.  

We don't recommend using the root account as this creates security issues.  In addition AWS strongly discourages creating API keys for the root user.  As such we create another user and use that user account to login and create AWS resources. 

## AWS CLI

The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) can be downloaded [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).  We do recommend installing the optional autocomplete if it is available for your operating system as it allows you to type commands faster.

## Git Clone

As you'll want to use the sample code for this course, you should clone this repo: 

```
git clone git@github.com:vallard/MicroServicesOnAWS.git
```

Then you can make changes as you go along.
