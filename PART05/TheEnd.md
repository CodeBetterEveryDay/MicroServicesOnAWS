# The End

Thank you for going through this lab!  I hope that it was enjoyable and that you learned some cool tricks and were inspired to build more things for yourself!

We were able to do a lot for very cheap dollars!  At the end of this lab you should not have spent more than $1!

That is incredible given what you get for your efforts. AWS microservices constantly evolve and cooler ways are developed all the time. 

A few things to notice: 

* You built a distributed Photo App in under 3 hours that can scale past the amount of real users you can acquire!
* Some of the microservices we built on our own (Our lambda functions) but most of them we just used!
* We can switch out different parts.  If we decide Cognito is not good enough, we can use [Auth0](https://auth0.com). Same with the database and object storage. 
* What else could you add to this?  How about search, using [Elastisearch](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/es/home?region=us-west-2#)?  What about email notifications with [SES](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-west-2#)?  There are so many ways to take this!

Thanks!
