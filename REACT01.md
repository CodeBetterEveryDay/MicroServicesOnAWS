# React Application

Create a new react appliction by running: 

```
mkdir front-end
cd front-end
create-react-app . 
```
Fire it up to see the default application: 

```
yarn start
```

Now let's add some styles: 

```
yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap react-router-dom
```
Open up `./src/index.js`.  After the last import add a new import: 

```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

You'll see some subtle changes in the app as it reloads.
