# Cognito

[Cognito is AWS's simple sign up, sign in, and access control micro service](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).  It allows you to easily add Facebook / Google sign in as well as other federated identities.  For our purpose, we'll just use the normal email and password features of the service. 

Once we have this, we can add it into our React Application and let our users sign in.
